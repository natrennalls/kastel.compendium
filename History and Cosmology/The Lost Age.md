The Lost Age of the planet Kastel is a history marked by the fading of magic and the decline of civilization.

## The Lost Origin
The magic begins to slip and fade from reality. Religious practitioners lose contact with their deities. The Clipse, a year-long period of darkness in which society attempted to save everything they could (magic, gods, divine abilities, cities, all abilities to record history during this time), signals the beginning of The Fading.

### Key Events

#### The Fading 
As magic fades, civilization fades with it, disrupting all facets of life. The Kingdom of Kez, an ancient kingdom to the southwest, falls. Its three vast walls are silent after a great cataclysm. The Massacre of Thistle occurs. A constant state of entropy causes sickness to take hold faster than normal, called the Stoneblight.


#### The Claiming of Kez 
Overlords of fae and mundane origin take refuge in the abandoned city of Kez, creating a paradigm of treachery, terror, and carnage. A man named Akiris arrives in the city of Kez and begins claiming power under cover of the city's chaos. Kez's Overlords seal the city from the inside, with the remaining horrific inhabitants as a deterrent to visitors. Akiris begins using an unknown power within Kez, without notice from the outside world.

#### The Tearing 
The lack of magic supporting the world's leylines caused an infrastructural fallout. A group of magic naysayers begins campaigning against those who use magic, named Scrollburners. Some adventurers from the surface descend into the newly opened Underdark to search for the font of magic.

#### The Discovery of the God Blades 
Weapons bearing almost deific power begin to appear. Examples include a crescent dagger named the Suture that heals those "cut" by the blade and many others. Akiris, Grand Vizer of the Void, discovers that as a God Blade is used, the powers of its patron deity within the vicinity of the bearer are increased (the Domain begins to affect the reality around the bearer). The knowledge of the God Blades and the rumored hidden artifacts becomes known far and wide, growing into legend.

#### The Conquest of Akiris 
Akiris begins his campaign to conquer the world with his army of Kezian denizens warped by his God, Blade. Akiris have begun to enslave illithids to discover how to harness the hive-mind sorcery of their lineage. The Company ends Akiris' war using a God Blade. The god Aurora's blade resurrects the fallen bodies around The Company's leader, Besarus. The tide turns against the Grand Vizer of the Void. Those who were once servants to his power are turned against him, and though his power does not leave him, he is smothered by the mountain of bodies created by those he once claimed as vassals.



## The Spark
The Spark occurs, restarting the latent magic within the universe. A magical renaissance causes tremendous change and advancements. The magic pouring out from the shattered leylines of the world causes a resurgence of the dormant magical races left over from the Fading. The world faces a massive tide of rampant magical creatures that begin to wreak havoc, with more intelligent monsters seizing power in this magically supersaturated climate. The world's mortal races begin a desperate fight against these wild attacks, learning what they can of this new source of magic to defend themselves. The fight's nature and secular ties create a winner-takes-all mentality as mortal allegiances disappear. Those still alive and afflicted by Stoneblight become leperous fonts of magic called the Ignidas. A conflict between the older Stoneblight carriers from before the Spark and the younger, more able-bodied generation begins to brew.

### Key Events

#### An Old Domain Returns
Myrkul and the gods of his Domain return to the world, kickstarting a resurgence of necromancy. Kelemvor orchestrates the death of his entire domain. In response, Orcus awakens and rouses his newly swollen ranks of demons to claim the Nine Hells. Knowing that the new Blood War would annihilate creation, Asmodeus brokers a treaty with Kelemvor. The forces of Orcus are pushed back to their domain, the source of the newly invigored army of the Lords of the Nine Hells unknown.

#### The Hearthen Gods 
Humanity, after the Spark, encounter the first Hearthen God, beings created from the faith and collective subconsciousness of mortals. These Gods and their charges create a golden age of true innovation. Magical and technological advancements are plentiful and generate many feats, like floating cities, skyships, and much more. During this time, the elves vanished, with the dragons stepping in as stewards of the natural order.


## The God War 
The Old Gods return and wage war on the mortal races and their newfound patrons, the Hearthen Gods. The Hearthen Gods manifest God blades to prepare for the oncoming war with the Old Gods. Not much is known about the result of the war, other than their war's final climatic battle shook the foundation of reality, and no gods survive in present day.
