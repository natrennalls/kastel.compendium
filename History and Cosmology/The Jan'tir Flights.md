The Jan'Tir dragonflight guards the balance of the elements, preserving the memory of the once-great elven civilization and maintaining the stability of the world.

## A Draconic Rise

## The Jan'tir Crusade
- the new flight, unified under one banner, called the leaders of all dragonflights to a summit to discuss the future of dragonkin.
- Talks dissolved to lines drawn in the sand
- The Jan'tir flights, though more powerful by a great deal, were outnumbered by the now swollen ranks of Red, Black, Green, and White 
	- Turned to their druidic counterparts, the [[Nyamira Tunda]], and the infamous [[Toussaint Family]]  in exchange for a unique payment for each group

### Undisclosed History

> [!warning] SECRET
> -  The [[Toussaint Family]] asked for two boons. First, they wanted the bones, blood, and scales of every dragon they put down. Second, they wanted the boon of "the strongest defector of the Reds", allowing them access to the affinity of fire
> - The [[[Nyamira Tunda]] ] asked for a blood oath from the Jan'Tir, binding them to two clauses
> 	- No acting member of their union will work against the balance of natural order and power 
> 	- The Jan'Tir and the Nyamira Tunda will act impartial of the mortal factions, taking no side and giving no favor to anyone outside of the [[Toussaint Family]].

What ensued was a brutal, yet quick crusade against those flights who chose to oppose natural order.

### The Fate of the Flights

> - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Red</mark>
>  - The red dragonflight, known for their fiery temperaments and aggressive nature, suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat to the far corners of Kastel. Eventually, their numbers dwindled to the point of extinction, unable to recover from their defeat.
> - <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Black</mark>
>  - The black dragonflight, characterized by their cunning and manipulative nature, attempted to form alliances with other dragonflights to regain their strength. However, their reputation as treacherous and unreliable made it difficult for them to find allies, and they were eventually hunted to extinction by the Jan'Tir dragonflight.

> [!note] Unknown
>  - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Green </mark>
>  -  The green dragonflight fought from the shadows, using their guile to sow discord among the allies of the Jan'Tir dragonflight. It was because of this subterfuge that, even now, the alliances between the Jan'Tir and the [[Toussaint Family]]  are strained after a clever illusion allowed a Jan'Tir to be slain by the Toussaint Primus, [[Pelas Toussaint]]. The Jan'Tir spared no expense to eradicate this species of dragon, and though there are no records of any surviving, the Jan'Tir are ever vigilant for their poisonous presence.

> [!check] Extinct
>  - <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">White </mark>
> 	 - The white dragonflight, having been drawn into the conflict against their will, proved to be the most resilient of the aggressor dragonflights, putting up a fierce resistance against the Jan'Tir. However, in the end, they were unable to overcome the elemental forces wielded by the Jan'Tir dragonflight, and were decimated.
>  - <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Blue</mark>
> 	 - The blue dragonflight, with their intelligence and cunning, had initially seemed to be a powerful asset to the aggressors. However, as the war raged on, they found themselves struggling to keep pace with the relentless pace of the conflict, and eventually suffered a series of defeats at the hands of the Jan'Tir.

## The Solstice 

3 months after the crusade, a summit of the seasonal dragonflight was called to consider the changes taking hold within each dragonflight. Affinities and personalities began to cause physical and intrinsic changes within the flight, with four of the fifteen dragons growing drastically in power and stature. It was decided that these four had been chosen by the Natural Balance to represent the ebb and flow of seasons that must exist for life to continue.
