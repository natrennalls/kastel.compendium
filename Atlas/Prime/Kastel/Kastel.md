# Kastel


A world once ravaged by a dire history of war and loss, and left overgrown and wild from the fallout of the end of a cataclysmic conflict. Kastel now exists on the precipice of a new mortal age. The humanoid inhabitants that have survived in seclusion pit themselves against the wild and savage frontier that surrounds them. Dark and foreboding forests lead to unknowable depths that chart deep into the planets crust, while vast dilapidated citadels of terrestrial and celestial nature dot the surface, each facet of uncharted territory holding the histories, and horrors, of old. Yet all is not as dire as it appears, for the frontier has seen fit to equip the intrepid races of this new age with the boons and wonders left by their ancestors. Floating mega-metropili of technological and magical ingenuity have crashed to the surface of this wrecked land and now act as the backbone of the  technical and magical advancements in the use and protection of everything Kastel has to offer.
