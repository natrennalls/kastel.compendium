## First major city to stand/survive against the horde?

- [[Goldbreak]] 
	- The survivors from the now-sunken [[Farshore]] dragged themselves exhausted from the Eastern sea. Not knowing about the marauding bands of War Beasts, they then fought tooth and nail to their sister city, [[Goldbreak]], when they joined their landbound families in weathering this storm of maddened monsters.


## Did they fight back?

- They fought thru the act of connecting it's people to one another. Communication thru the Underground allowed [[The Depmorian Diarchy]] to survive until [[The Draven Marches]] and the [[United Kingdom of Belsong]] forces made their way West.


##  Why were they there in the first place?

- [[Farshore]] fell, the magic holding it above the surf failed. It dragged most of their fleet and resources to the bottom of the West Sea.

	- The Katari [[Far Shore Clan]], on their windskiff ships, ushered as many of their fellow civilians off the sinking city
