Once upon a time, in the land of Depmoria, the mighty river of Goldbreak flowed with veins of pure gold. The lords and ladies of the land claimed the lion's share of the precious metal, leaving the lower class of civilians struggling to make ends meet.

Enter the founder of the thieves guild, known only as "The Master of the Salutation". The Master was a charismatic halfling with a sharp wit and a passion for justice. Observing the suffering of the people, The Master decided to take action.

The Master journeyed to the Far Shores, a mystical land beyond the horizon, seeking the help of the Katari Far Shores Clan. The Clan, known for their magical abilities and connection to the Order of the Myst, agreed to aid The Master in his quest for justice.

Together, The Master and the Far Shores Clan established the thieves guild of Salutation. The guild operated in secret, using their cunning and magical powers to steal from the rich and give to the poor. The members of the guild each carried a unique weapon, a kukri with damascus patterning and a faint green shade to the metal. These weapons were said to hold the power of the Far Shores and the Order of the Myst, imbuing their wielders with the strength to carry out their mission.

The Master of the Salutation also sought the assistance of the Lorgaire family, renowned for their culinary expertise. With their help, the thieves guild established a restaurant of the same name, operating as the face of the guild and providing for the lower class with their culinary creations.

Thus, the diarchy of the state of Depmoria was formed, with the Katari Far Shores Clan and the halfling Lorgaire family ruling together in harmony. The thieves guild of Salutation continued to operate in secret, using their mystical weapons and delicious cuisine to bring justice to the land of Depmoria and provide for those in need.
