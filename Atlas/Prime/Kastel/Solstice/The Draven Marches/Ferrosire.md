# [[Ferrosire]] 
Location: On the eastern coast of [[Solstice]]

Ferrosire, the City of the Sun, was protected from the massive storms and supercells that plagued the area by its unique aetheric anomalies. The convergence of aetheric energy created permanent gravity wells within the city limits, which acted as a barrier against the storm winds and waves. The spontaneous magnetism of metals in the area also helped to deflect the lightning and other electrical phenomena associated with the storms, making Ferrosire a safe haven for its inhabitants.

The increased sunlight in Ferrosire also played a role in the frequency of the storms, but the aetheric anomalies made it possible for the city to weather them with minimal damage. This made Ferrosire a hub for inventors and engineers who sought to harness the aetheric energy and create new technologies to protect against the storms. Over time, the city became known as the City of the Sun and a symbol of resilience against the forces of nature.
